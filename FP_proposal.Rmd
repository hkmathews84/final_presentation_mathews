"Introduction"

Focus will be on the **state_stats** dataset. The main question I will be exploring is, ***"What connection, if any, exists between population size, poverty, and robbery?"***

I got the dataset from OpenIntro datasets, under **usdata**. **State_stats** is one of 13 datasets inside of **usdata**.

  Some information about OpenIntro datasets:
    *Directly from their site, it says, "Supplemental functions and data for OpenIntro resources, which includes open-source textbooks and resources for introductory statistics."*

The data was collected from the official US Census website along with various other sources.

There are `r ncol(state_stats)` variables and `r nrow(state_stats)` observations in the dataset. Each variable represents a different category, relating to many things, ranging from population to income to federal spending. Each observation represents the state that the data was collected from.

Along with population, poverty, and robbery, I will also be looking at individuals collecting social security, federal spending, and income per capita. These will not effect my conclusions regarding the dataset but I found them interesting to explore alongside my main question.
